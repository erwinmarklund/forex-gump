1- Does the API respond with the proper codes in the three tested cases? Why?
Answer:
Two of the tests were sucessful as 200 which means "success".

One test gave a different code because the expected status code is 200
but we got 500 which is a response you get for unhandled exceptions.
 Code 400 is what is expected and this should be the way to go in this case.

2- Do Dtos need to be tested?
Answer:
No.
Why?
Unit tests are not necessary for DTOs, getters and setters should
only be tested when they contain complex logic.

3- Criticize the application. Reveal the weak parts you can spot and propose ideas to improve them.
For access to the application during deployment, team members have to use the same account
on github otherwise.
