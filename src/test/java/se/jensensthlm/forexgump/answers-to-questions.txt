1- Does the API respond with the proper codes in the three tested cases? Why?
Answer:
Two of the tests were sucessful as 200 which means "success".

One test gave a different code because the expected status code is 200
but we got 500 which is a response you get for unhandled exceptions.
 Code 400 is what is expected and this should be the way to go in this case.

2- Do Dtos need to be tested?
Answer:
No.
Why?
Unit tests are not necessary for DTOs, getters and setters should
only be tested when they contain complex logic.
The DTOs would be used by services that would still be tested indirectly.
If your data has no behaviour.

3- Criticize the application. Reveal the weak parts you can spot and propose ideas to improve them.

Answer:
It's easier to consume an existing API than to create one.
Some of the weak points of the application are:
We had some results that revealed a code of 500 instead of 400.
There was no difference in the outcome of the sell and buy functions in certain instances.
